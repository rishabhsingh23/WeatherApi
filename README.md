# WeatherApi

This is a very basic project to understand how apis work. I have used openweathermap api to fetch the temperature and Weather description from this api.

The user has to input a city name if the data for that city is avilable api will give the data and it will be displayed in the frontend but if the data is not avilable it will redirect you to a page which says no data avialable.

Code to run: go to the directory where your app.js is and perform following steps:

1.npm install

2.node app.js

3.go to localhost 3000 on chrome
